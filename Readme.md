## Uso
For the proper use of the application, keep in mind that it is divided into frontend and backend in such a way that you must run each application for its perfect functioning. You should also keep in mind that you must create the database according to the guidelines or configurations established in the run.sh file.

The application consists of 6 processes such as:
- create note: This process allows you to add new notes. In the same way, it is validated that at the time of creating the note the fields are not empty and subsequently it is asked if you want to add more notes or not.
- edit note: This process allows you to edit new notes.Likewise, in this option you can modify whether a note is archived or not since one of the fields refers to the status of the note. Once the value is modified, you can go to list the archived or non-archived notes to view. information.
- delete note: This process allows you to delete new notes.
- list notes: In this component all notes are listed regardless of whether they are archived or not.
- list archived notes: only lists archived notes
- list unfiled notes: only lists unarchived notes
